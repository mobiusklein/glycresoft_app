    GlycReSoft is a program that provides algorithms for glycan and glycopeptide identification
    and quantification. It is also the focus of a Ph.D. thesis. The underlying models are evolving
    all of the time to incorporate new information. The author reserves the right to rewrite things,
    in a backwards-incompatible fashion.
